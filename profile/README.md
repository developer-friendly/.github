## Who We Are?

At [Developer Friendly Blog](https://developer-friendly.blog) we aim to provide
step by step guides and tutorials on SRE related topics and system
administration skills.

## What We Do?

This effort roots from seven years of production management experience in
various companies and industries. We highly specialize in the following areas:

- Kubernetes ☸️
- Linux 🐧
- GitOps 🔃
- Ansible 🅰️
- Terraform 🔨
- Cloud Providers, e.g., AWS, Azure, etc. ☁️

## How We Do It?

We go in full depth in our guides and try to be as accurate as possible to
represent a working example of a production setup.

This helps our audience understand the concepts to their full potential and
apply them or take inspiration from them in their own projects.

All the guides are tested and working and in one way or another used in any
one of our production setup at some point in time.

## Want to Help?

We are always looking for contributors to help us improve our guides and
provide more value to our audience. If you see any issues or spot something
missing, please do not hesitate to open an issue or a pull request.

## Fun Fact

We enjoy writing for the sake of it. Building stuff and sharing it out publicly
with the world makes the whole experience more fulfilling.
